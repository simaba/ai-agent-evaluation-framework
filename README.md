A structured framework for evaluating AI agents across task performance, safety,
reliability, and governance dimensions — designed for regulated industry deployment.

## Evaluation Dimensions

### 1. Task Performance

| Metric | Description | Measurement Method |
|---|---|---|
| **Task Completion Rate** | % of tasks completed without error | Automated test suite against benchmark scenarios |
| **Goal Achievement Rate** | % of tasks where the final goal was met | Human or LLM judge evaluation |
| **Step Efficiency** | Average steps taken vs. optimal path | Comparison to expert baseline |
| **Tool Use Accuracy** | Correct tool selection and parameter passing | Automated verification |
| **Output Quality** | Correctness and usefulness of agent outputs | Rubric-based LLM judge |

### 2. Safety and Reliability

| Metric | Description | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **Hallucination Rate** | Factually incorrect statements in outputs | < 2% on factual tasks |
| **Harmful Output Rate** | Outputs violating safety guidelines | 0% (hard limit) |
| **Refusal Appropriateness** | Correct refusal of inappropriate requests | > 95% |
| **Prompt Injection Resistance** | Resistance to adversarial user inputs | Tested via red team suite |
| **Consistency** | Same input → consistent output class | > 90% across N runs |

### 3. Operational Reliability

| Metric | Description | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **Availability** | Uptime under normal and peak load | ≥ 99.5% |
| **P99 Latency** | 99th percentile response time | ≤ configured SLA |
| **Error Rate** | % of requests resulting in unhandled errors | < 0.1% |
| **Cost per Task** | Token cost per successful task completion | Tracked against budget |
| **Graceful Degradation** | Behavior when tools or dependencies fail | Tested via fault injection |

### 4. Governance and Auditability

| Metric | Description | Pass Criterion |
|---|---|---|
| **Decision Traceability** | Can every output be traced to inputs and reasoning? | Full trace available |
| **Tool Call Logging** | All external tool calls logged with parameters | 100% logged |
| **Human Escalation Rate** | % of tasks escalated to human review | Tracked; threshold defined |
| **Sensitive Data Handling** | PII/sensitive data not leaked in outputs or logs | 0 violations |
| **Override Capability** | Operator can halt or override agent at any point | Verified in testing |

## Evaluation Scenarios

### Standard Benchmark Suite

| Scenario | Description | Difficulty |
|---|---|---|
| Single-step task | Agent completes a straightforward, well-defined task | Basic |
| Multi-step task | Agent plans and executes a sequence of actions | Intermediate |
| Ambiguous instruction | Agent clarifies or handles an underspecified request | Intermediate |
| Tool failure | Agent handles a tool returning an error | Intermediate |
| Adversarial input | Agent resists a prompt injection attempt | Advanced |
| Novel situation | Agent encounters a task outside its training distribution | Advanced |
| Cascading failure | Multiple tools fail in sequence | Advanced |
| Human escalation | Agent correctly identifies when to escalate | Advanced |

### Regulated Industry Scenarios

| Industry | Scenario | Key Evaluation Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| Healthcare | Clinical documentation assistant | Factual accuracy, no hallucination, appropriate refusal |
| Finance | Transaction analysis agent | Regulatory compliance, auditability, no PII leakage |
| Insurance | Claims assessment agent | Fairness across subgroups, decision traceability |
| Legal | Contract review agent | Citation accuracy, scope awareness, human escalation |
